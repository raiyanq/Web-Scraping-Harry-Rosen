# Web-Scraping-Harry-Rosen
This repository contains a web scraping script I wrote to get information from the Harry Rosen site and do some simple pandas operations on it. It retreives information from the page of all new products in the Harry Rosen website and then creates a table (dataframe) with the maximum product price for each brand. It then creates a plot of this information.
